# Array
Array is an object that contains different types of data in sequential order.

### **Array Time Complexities**
    Get: O(1)

    Push: O(1)

    Pop: O(1)

    Search: O(n)

    Insert: O(n)

    Delete: O(n)

### **When to use?**
- Arrays are most efficient when accessing the elements in random order by index or modifying only at the end of the array. Any modification to the middle of the array results in O(n) running time.

### **Pros**
- Fast lookup
- Fast Push/Pop
- Ordered

### **Cons**
- Slow inserts/deletes
