# Stack
- Stacks is a data structure where the last entered data is the first to come out. Also known as Last-in, First-out (LIFO).It's like no of plates put on top of each other, last plate is accesible first OR browser history stack.
- Examples: Undo operation in IDE, function written insided another functions

- Stack can be implmeneted using arrays and linked list.
- Array provides caching localities because its in order in memory so its faster then linked list which is scattered all over place..Also linked list needs more memory to point to the next node. So array is more efficient way to create stack.

### **Stack Time Complexities**
    Push: O(1)

    Pop: O(1)

    Peek: O(1)

    Lookup: O(n)

### **When to use?**
- Stacks are most useful for pop and push items.  

### **Pros**
- Fast Peek
- Fast Push/Pop
- Ordered

### **Cons**
- Slow lookup
